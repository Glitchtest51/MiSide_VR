# MiSide_VR
WIP Mod to make MiSide playable in VR

Currently renders and displays in the headset, no controller input yet, no menus, none of the 2d stuff, no body tracking, etc, just renders in vr, camera placement is also off currently.

This mod uses a edited version of [PureDark's SteamVR_Standalone_IL2CPP Fork](https://github.com/PureDark/SteamVR_Standalone_IL2CPP) edited for MiSide, this mod probably wont be completed entirely since PureDark is developing a VR mod, this project used [GunfireRebornVRMod](https://github.com/PureDark/GunfireRebornVRMod) and a unreleased SlimeRancher2 VR Mod (also by PureDark) as reference, i started this project on January ‎9 ‎2025 ‏‎10 PM EST
